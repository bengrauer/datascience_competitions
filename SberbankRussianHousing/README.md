## Description of Script
My very first attempt at a kaggle competition.  I joined one month before the submission deadline, and more for a learning excercise.  I didn't get enough time to incorporate the macro level economy details and just focused on the housing features/cost.  Script was developed with R Studio, and then formatted to run in full with setting local variables.  Broken into main pieces of: load, data-clean, plotting, model/predicting.  Used linear regression and polynomial regression for the majority of submissions.
