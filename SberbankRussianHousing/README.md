## Description of Script
First attempt at a kaggle competition.  I joined one month before the submission deadline, and more for a learning excercise.  Given the time constraints just focused on the housing features/cost.  Script was developed with R Studio, and then formatted to run in full with setting local variables.  Broken into main pieces of: load, data-clean, plotting, model/predicting.  Used linear regression and polynomial regression for the majority of submissions.  

Learning Takeaways: 1) Post wrap-up learned to implement hiearchy leveling to obtain a better testing score. 2) Should have traded off more time on plotting/diagnostics rather than feature engineering given the time constraints.
